<br>A. Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis
<br>jz2792's Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis are formulated correctly. Personally, I
<br>like her idea of defferent average trip durations of customers and subscribers. Because 
<br>custmers pay for one time, as subscriber pay for unlimited rides in a certain time, so customers
<br>would maximize their riding time for a better benefit. Also, most of customers are tourists, and 
<br>most of subscribers are local people. So, I think JZ has got a good point.

<br>B.JZ drops lots of unrelated data, only keeps "tripduration","usertype",and "date".At first I am 
<br>a little confused why would jz keep the "date" data. But then I find jz 
<br>prepares "date" data to show that customers average riding time are always longer than that of
<br>subscribers from Monday to Sunday. So, I think jz chooses the right data for the following analysis.

<br>C.I fail to find the test in JZ's HW3_Assign_2 . But I would suggest t-Test as a statistical test. Because
<br>t-Test answers the question like "Do difference exist between 2 groups on  one DV?" Exactly like
<br>JZ's Question-----"Do difference exist between customers and subscribers on trip duration?"
